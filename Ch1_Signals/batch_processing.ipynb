    "### Objective\n",
    "Implement recursive file discovery and batch processing with segmental analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search for files recursively**\n",
    "   - Recursively search for all files with a given extension within a folder\n",
    "   - Store all file paths in a Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "   - Save the DataFrame as a CSV text file\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process each file in a loop**\n",
    "   - Read the contents of each file (signal waveform, image, etc.)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Process segments within each file** (e.g., windows of N=100 samples or blocks of 8×8 pixels):\n",
    "     - Calculate the energy $e_i$ of the i-th segment and store in an array\n",
    "     - Print the energy of each segment/block to standard output\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Visualization**\n",
    "     - Plot the signal information and its segmental energy using `subplot(2,1,1)` and `subplot(2,1,2)`\n",
    "     - Display the signal waveform in one subplot and the energy curve (energy per segment) in the other"

    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learn file properties**\n",

    "   - Use $T_s$ to calculate the duration of each waveform or segment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate statistics**\n",
    "   - Perform similar processing as Part I to compute statistics for each file:\n",
    "     - **Amplitude statistics:** minimum, maximum, and mean amplitude\n",
    "     - **Duration statistics:** minimum, maximum, and mean duration (if working with waveforms)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Repeat histogram calculation**\n",
    "   - Perform the same histogram calculations as Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Save histograms as PNG files**\n",
    "   - For each file with extension \"myextension\" in the input root folder\n",
    "   - Create a corresponding PNG output file with the same name and subfolder structure\n",
    "   - **Example:** \n",
    "     - Input: `inputfolder\\subfolder1\\subfolder2\\myname.wav`\n",
    "     - Output: `outputfolder\\subfolder1\\subfolder2\\myname.png`\n",
    "   - `outputfolder` is provided by the user as a command-line argument\n",

    "3. **Folder management**\n",

    "### Important Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avoid Magic Numbers\n",
    "- **Never use hardcoded values** scattered throughout your code\n",
    "- Instead, define named constants at the top of your script with explanatory comments\n",
    "- **Bad example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for i in range(100):  # What does 100 mean?\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Good example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  SEGMENT_SIZE = 100  # Process audio in 100-sample segments\n",
    "  for i in range(SEGMENT_SIZE):\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Functions Effectively\n",
    "- Create reusable functions/methods whenever appropriate\n",
    "- This improves code readability, maintainability, and testability\n",
    "- Avoid repetitive code by extracting common operations into functions"
